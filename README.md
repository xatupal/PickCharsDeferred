# PickCharsDeferred
KeePass Plugin

Plugin changes the default behaviour of "{PICKCHARS}" placeholder.

Instead of asking for characters at the very begining of auto-type sequence, it will postpone it to the place where it was actually entered.

Useful when the login screen consists of two parts and it is not known in advance what characters will be needed.
